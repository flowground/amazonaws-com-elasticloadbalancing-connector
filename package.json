    "description": "Elastic Load Balancing A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across\nyour EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your\napplication. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered\ninstances and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy instances. You\nconfigure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or\nmore listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for\nconnections from clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for\nconnections from the load balancer to the instances.\n\nElastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load\nBalancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a\nload balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the \nElastic Load Balancing User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/].\n\nThis reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers.\nThe 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load\nBalancers.\n\nTo get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using \nCreateLoadBalancer. Register your instances with the load balancer using \nRegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer.\n\nAll Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they\ncomplete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK\nresponse code.",
